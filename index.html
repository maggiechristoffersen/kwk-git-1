  <h1>About Me</h1>
<article class="about">
    <p>I'm Maggie. I grew up in a small-ish city called Fairfax, Virginia, a couple miles away from Washington, D.C. I have been a KWK scholar three times over, and have learned so much in my experience! This summer will be my fourth summer as a KWK IA.</p>
    <p>I study data science at the University of Michigan. I am passionate about the ways that data can help people and have long been interested in data journalism! I'm excited to explore it in this KWK challenge. </p>
    <p>Besides coding, I really like dancing, reading, playing the Sims 4, and studying German. At school, I'm also have a minor in German and a minor in Science, Technology, and Society. </p>
    <p>I started at Kode With Klossy in 2019 at the Washington, D.C. camp! From there, I did camps in 2020 and 2021 before becoming an IA in 2022. This is my fourth summer as an IA for KWK, and I'm so excited to work with KWK for this virtual challenge! </p>
