<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Maggie's About Me Page!</h2>
<h3>Hi, I'm Maggie! I'm a college student at the University of Michigan, and I'm trying out the KWK Data Storytelling Challenge as a way to grow my web development and data journalism skills!</h3>
<p>I'm Maggie. I grew up in a small-ish city called Fairfax, Virginia, a couple miles away from Washington, D.C. I have been a KWK scholar three times over, and have learned so much in my experience! This summer will be my fourth summer as a KWK IA.</p>
<p>I study data science at the University of Michigan. I am passionate about the ways that data can help people and have long been interested in data journalism! I'm excited to explore it in this KWK challenge. </p>
<p>Besides coding, I really like dancing, reading, playing the Sims 4, and studying German. At school, I'm also have a minor in German and a minor in Science, Technology, and Society. </p>
